# My very first website

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This website was built to become familiar with using IDE and working with git commands when making changes in files and how to deploy the site. 

Please check out [My first website](https://aoifesmith.github.io/my-full-template/) now! 

## Project Description
Working on this site provided the opportunity to familarise myself with Gitpod & GitHub and how they interact. Carrying out operations like commit, push and making changes to the code and steps needed to have these updated to the deployed site. I learned some basics on wrting the README.md file

## [Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology)
This project was written in HTML & CSS using the editor on Gitpod and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
